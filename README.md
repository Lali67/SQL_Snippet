## T-SQL 
 Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is an extension of SQL. It is considered as procedural language, unlike SQL that is used by SQL server. It is helpful in doing operations like getting the data from a single row, addition of new rows, getting multiple rows. The syntax is different from others like PL-SQL. However, it has the same functionality and generates similar results as other languages. This is the Microsoft implementation of the structured query language for SQL server.
